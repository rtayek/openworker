### AI Handoff: Prompt Complexity Classification & Model Routing Strategy

### 1. Context Overview

* **Project Domain:** LLM Chat Capture, Retrieval, and Search Platform.
* **Target Tech Stack:** Java, Gradle, Eclipse, Bash, Git [Explicit Memory].
* **Available Models:** Claude Fable 5 (Monster), Claude Opus 5 (Workhorse), Claude Sonnet 5.6 (Lightweight Agentic).
* **Objective:** Build an automated pre-filtering router to scan incoming developer prompts. The router determines task complexity to seamlessly choose between low-cost, high-velocity models (Sonnet 5.6) and deep structural reasoning systems (Fable 5).

### 2. Structural Routing Pipeline

The following architectural diagram outlines how incoming prompts are evaluated against context footprints, linguistic intents, and environmental depth before hitting a target model.

       and ambiguous error tracing.       fixes, and immediate executions.

### 3. Core Technical Dimensions for Routing

### Context Footprint

* **Lightweight (Sonnet 5.6):** Targets an isolated loop, a standalone helper utility, or a localized logic snippet.
* **Monster (Fable 5):** Targets broad imports, multi-module cascades, and systems where modifying an interface requires synchronized edits across multiple packages.

### Action Verbs & Keywords

* **Lightweight:** High frequency of Write, Generate, Script, Fix syntax, Explain, Convert.
* **Monster:** High frequency of Refactor, Redesign, Migrate, Audit, Analyze architecture, Trace memory leak.

### Build & Lifecycle Complexity

* **Lightweight:** Execution scripts independent of build lifecycles or simple terminal tasks.
* **Monster:** Structural modifications requiring alignment with build.gradle scripts, project-wide dependency resolution, or multi-step compiler verification loops.

### 4. Next Incremental Step

Implement a micro-router within your platform. It should default to Sonnet 5.6 for raw typing velocity, parsing the prompt via a rapid keyword array or regex validator, and immediately escalates the state to Fable 5 the second a multi-file file boundary or structural refactoring constraint is flagged.
