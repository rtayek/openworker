# A2A Experiment Findings

**Observed:** 2026-09-02 through 2026-09-04
**Protocol:** A2A 1.0 over JSON-RPC
**Java SDK:** 1.3.0.Final
**Server:** Quarkus reference JSON-RPC server 3.39.1
**Client:** Official A2A Java client

## Result

Continue studying A2A through a bounded package in ChatMap.

After the initial protocol experiments, the nested Gradle project was
consolidated into the regular `chatmap.a2a.experiment` Java package. Following
a green full Gradle check and successful runtime continuation test, Ray approved
its merge into `master`.

The protocol successfully provides discovery, task identity, context identity,
status, messages, artifacts, and same-task continuation across an opaque agent
boundary. It does not provide ChatMap's durable ledger, semantic-preservation
guarantees, worker sessions, or predecessor and successor assignment model.

## Demonstrated Behavior

| Request | Observed state | Artifact or message |
|---|---|---|
| `complete:hello` | `TASK_STATE_COMPLETED` | Artifact `fake-worker-result` containing `hello` |
| `input-required` | `TASK_STATE_INPUT_REQUIRED` | Agent message requesting additional text |
| `fail` | `TASK_STATE_FAILED` | Agent message explaining the requested failure |
| Same-task continuation | `INPUT_REQUIRED` to `COMPLETED` | Same task and context IDs; artifact containing `continued hello` |
| Ollama model request | `TASK_STATE_COMPLETED` | Artifact `worker-result` containing the local Qwen response |

The continuation response retained both the agent's request for input and the
user's follow-up in task history. It completed the original task rather than
creating a successor task.

On 2026-09-04, the bounded server advertised the
`ollama-text-generation` skill and completed a real request through the local
`qwen2.5:7b` model. The 48-second client run returned a two-sentence
`worker-result` artifact.

On 2026-09-06 local time, `a2aModelRecord` repeated that path and stored the
real task in an isolated ChatMap home. Session 1 reached `COMPLETED` with two
lifecycle events and two artifacts: the raw A2A task snapshot and the model
text. A separate `workerLifecycleRecord` process reopened the database and
displayed the same task ID, context ID, state, transitions, and artifact
locations. This proves durable structural recording across process exit.

The Agent Card was retrieved from
`/.well-known/agent-card.json`. It advertised one text skill and one JSON-RPC
interface using protocol version 1.0.

The official CLI had no published release during this experiment, so the
released official Java client was used.

## Mapping to ChatMap

| ChatMap | Observed A2A fit | Important difference |
|---|---|---|
| Worker identity | Agent Card | An Agent Card describes a service and its skills, not a particular worker session. |
| Assignment | Message plus Task | A2A creates a task from a message; ChatMap records the assignment separately from execution. |
| Work session | Task plus context ID | A2A context groups interaction, but does not model ChatMap's session and retirement semantics. |
| Lifecycle event | Task status | States map well, including failed and input-required. A blocking client receives the resulting task rather than every intermediate transition. |
| Waiting for decision | `TASK_STATE_INPUT_REQUIRED` | Continuation reuses the same task and context; ChatMap separately models the decision and its durable provenance. |
| Worker artifact | Artifact | The structural mapping is direct. A2A does not make the artifact durable by itself. |
| Semantic handoff | Message or artifact content | A2A transports content but does not guarantee that important meaning was preserved. |
| Successor assignment | No direct equivalent observed | Context IDs, task references, or metadata may relate work, but same-task continuation is not a ChatMap successor chain. |
| Durable ledger | No protocol guarantee | Durability depends on the server implementation. ChatMap can record the externally visible A2A exchange. |

## What ChatMap Can Record Without Agent Internals

ChatMap can record:

- the Agent Card used for discovery;
- the submitted message;
- task ID and context ID;
- returned task state;
- agent status messages;
- artifact identity, name, content, and location;
- timestamps and transport metadata.

ChatMap does not need, and A2A does not expose:

- hidden prompts;
- private reasoning;
- internal memory;
- internal tools;
- the remote implementation plan.

## Limits of This Slice

This experiment did not test:

- streaming status updates;
- task persistence across server restart;
- authentication or authorization;
- push notifications;
- REST or gRPC;
- concurrency, retries, or scheduling;
- semantic preservation.

The worker tests prove deterministic branching. They do not prove A2A transport
conformance or semantic preservation. The real Qwen response interpreted the
otherwise general phrase "durable task history" as Azure Functions. That answer
was structurally preserved but contextually over-specific, demonstrating that
durability does not establish relevance or semantic quality.

Two manual calibration prompts exposed additional limits. The model first
upgraded a recorded timeout reason into a causal claim. Under a stricter
contract, it avoided the prohibited causal phrases but joined two required
sentences with a semicolon and reversed the supplied retry-policy fact. A
dedicated structured probe now requires exact factual fields and lets Java,
rather than the model, decide acceptance.

The live structured probe subsequently passed. The model returned exactly
`state=FAILED`, `reportedReason=worker timeout`,
`retryPolicy=PROHIBITED`, and `causalConclusion=NOT_ESTABLISHED` in the
required order with no additional prose. Java performed the comparison. This is
one successful instruction-following case, not a general truthfulness result.

## Recommendation

Keep the A2A implementation bounded inside `chatmap.a2a.experiment`. Its
presence on `master` does not authorize database, UI, or general-orchestrator
integration.

The bounded recorder and model-backed vertical slice are complete. Before any
broader integration, choose a separate question: semantic-quality evaluation,
caller and decision provenance, or no further A2A expansion. Transport and
durable storage alone do not justify turning ChatMap into an orchestrator.
